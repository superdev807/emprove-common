      <br />
      Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Emprove, Inc. (“<strong>Emprove</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”)
      and our website at www.emproveit.com along with our related websites, networks, applications, mobile applications, and other services
      provided by us (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and
      Emprove regarding your use of the Service.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="terms-content__paragraph">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY.</span>
      <br />
      <strong>BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE</strong> YOU AGREE THAT YOU
      HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND
      CONDITIONS, INCLUDING EMPROVE’S PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THESE “<strong>TERMS</strong>”). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to
      the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND EMPROVE’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO
      YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY EMPROVE AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE. </strong>
      Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 18, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by
      binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND EMPROVE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
      PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your
      rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL
      ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. (See Section 18.)
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>1. Emprove Service Overview.</strong> Emprove provides a platform where people seeking contractors for home improvement and
      renovation projects (“<strong>Homeowners</strong>”) can submit information to the Service and generate a detailed scope of work,
      project cost estimate (“<strong>Estimate</strong>”) and a request for proposal (“<strong>RFP</strong>”). The Estimate is not an offer
      by us to provide construction services, nor is it a guaruntee of ultimate project costs. The RFP is provided for the purpose of
      soliciting bid proposals (“<strong>Bid Proposal</strong>”) from contractors (“<strong>Contractors</strong>”) (collectively, Homeowners
      and Contractors are referred to herein as “<strong>Users</strong>”). Any decision by a Contractor to submit a Bid Proposal in response
      to an RFP, by a Homeowner to accept a Bid Proposal, or by a User to enter into an agreement for a Contractor’s services upon
      acceptance of a Bid Proposal is made in such User’s sole discretion.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>2. Eligibility.</strong> You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and
      warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c)
      your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity,
      organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind
      you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>3. Accounts and Registration.</strong> To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you
      register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, or
      other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and
      up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the
      confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you
      believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at support@emproveit.com.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>4. General Payment Terms.</strong> Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you
      will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable
      <br />
      <br />
      <ul className="terms-content__unordered-list">
        <li>
          <strong>4.1 Price.</strong> Emprove reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Emprove will make reasonable efforts
          to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current
          pricing information. Emprove may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Emprove
          gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Emprove, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different
          features and different pricing to any of Emprove’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your
          offer or these Terms.

          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.2 Success Fee.</strong> If a Homeowner decides to accept a bid from a Contractor in response to an RFP, the Contractor
          will be required to pay a fee (the “<strong>Success Fee</strong>”) in order to be connected with the Homeowner through the
          Service. Contracting with or engaging another User of the Service for services similar to those included in any Estimate, RFP or
          Bid Proposal without paying the Success Fee is strictly prohibited.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.3 Authorization.</strong> You authorize Emprove to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service
          you select as described in these Terms or published by Emprove, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in
          your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Emprove may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your
          purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.4 Refunds.</strong> Except for the refunds described in this Section 4.4, all charges are non-refundable. If a Homeowner
          selects a Contractor for a project through the Service and the Contractor pays the Success Fee, Emprove, in its sole discretion,
          may refund all or a portion of the fees paid to Emprove by the Homeowner to publish the applicable RFP that resulted in the
          accepted proposal, as may be specified in the program materials at the time of RFP submission (“<strong>Eligible Refunds</strong>”).
          Eligible Refunds will be refunded to the payment method used to make the original purchase, and may take up to 10 business days to
          process following payment of the Success Fee. Homeowners will not be eligible for a refund if the Contractor does not pay the
          Success Fee.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.5 Delinquent Accounts.</strong> Emprove may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of
          the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid, including any account fees that would have been payable as a
          Success Fee or other applicable fee if consummated on the Service. Any fees not paid when due will accrue interest at the rate of
          1.5% per month or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is less. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a
          delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any of the unpaid
          amount, including collection fees.

      <br />
      NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR EMPROVE ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT
      AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE EMPROVE ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY
      STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE
      USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT
      RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR

      <br />
      <br />
      THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Emprove does not disclaim
      any warranty or other right that Emprove is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>17. Limitation of Liability </strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE EMPROVE ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
      CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR
      RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE,
      WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY EMPROVE
      ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.
      <br /> <br />
      EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 18.4 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE EMPROVE ENTITIES TO YOU
      FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE
      TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO EMPROVE FOR ACCESS TO
      AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100.
      <br /> <br />
      EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS
      INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF
      THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE
      LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

      <strong>18. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration </strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      <ul className="terms-content__unordered-list">
        <li>
          <strong>18.1 Generally. </strong>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Emprove in the most expedient and cost
          effective manner, and except as described in Section 18.2, you and Emprove agree that every dispute arising in connection with
          these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
          neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very
          limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate
          disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
          fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of
          these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND EMPROVE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
          JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>18.2 Exceptions. </strong>Despite the provisions of Section 18.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive,
          preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an
          enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief
          in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement
          claim.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>18.3 Arbitrator. </strong>Any arbitration between you and Emprove will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and
          administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively,
          “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at{' '}
          <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/" className="terms-content__link">
            www.adr.org
          </a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Emprove. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any
          dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>18.4 Notice of Arbitration; Process. </strong>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of
          the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has
          not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong>”). Emprove’s address for
          Notice is: Emprove, Inc., 10150 Covington Cross Drive, Las Vegas, NV  89144-6567. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the
          nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”). The parties
          will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days
          after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Emprove may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings
          between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of
          any settlement offer made by you or Emprove must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final
          decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by
          Emprove in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Emprove will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the
          arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>18.5 Fees. </strong> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Emprove will reimburse you for your
          payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by
          the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Clark County, NV, but if the claim is
          for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to
          the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA
          Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the
          relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal
          Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to
          reimburse Emprove for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
          Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient
          to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make
          rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon
          request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>18.6 No Class Actions. </strong>YOU AND EMPROVE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
          INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless
          both you and Emprove agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise
          preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>18.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. </strong>
          If Emprove makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Emprove’s address for Notice of
          Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Emprove’s address for Notice
          of Arbitration, in which case your account with Emprove will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in
          effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>18.8 Enforceability. </strong>If Section 18.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 18 is found
          to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 18 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the
          exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

          to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a
          waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or
          default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any
          impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not
          limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the
