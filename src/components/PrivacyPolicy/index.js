        This Privacy Policy (“<b>Policy</b>”) describes the manner in which Emprove, Inc. (“<b>Emprove</b>”, “<b>we</b>,” or “<b>us</b>”)
        and our website at emproveit.com (the “Site”), as well as all related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided
        by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, our “<b>Service</b>”) use and collect
        data from individuals. This Policy, which is incorporated into and is subject to the applicable Emprove Terms of Service, describes
        the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect
        such information. <br />
        <br />
        <b>Information We Collect on the Service:</b> <br />
        <br />
        <ul className="privacy-policy-content__list">
          <li>
            <b>User-provided Information.</b> When you use the Service, we may collect information about you, including your name, email
            address, mailing address, mobile phone number, credit card or other billing information, your date of birth, geographic area, or
            preferences and we may link this information with other information about you. You may provide us with information in various
            ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with information when you register for an account, use the Service, make a
            purchase on the Service, or send us customer service-related requests. <br />
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Cookies and Automatically Collected Information</b> When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text
            files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A
            session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used
            by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to
            modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be
            able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. <br />
            <br />
            We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear
            gifs" or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web
            browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or
            other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the
            Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as
            whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with
            other information about you. <br />
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Location Information. </b> We may obtain information about your physical location, such as by use of GPS and other
            geolocation features in your device, or by inference from other information we collect (for example, your IP address indicates
            the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet). <br />
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons. </b> We may display third-party content on the Service, including
            third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection
            with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as
            Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information
            collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Emprove. Information
            collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.{' '}

            Generally, we limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to
            perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information. <br />
