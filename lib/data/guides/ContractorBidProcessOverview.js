  body: ['At Emprove, contractors provide cost proposals to homeowners for projects that are well-defined and ready to go. There are **no lead fees** associated with submitting proposals. Contractors provide a preliminary proposal that is **subject to a project site inspection**. Proposals are adjusted, if needed, and finalized after the inspection. ', 'Below is a detailed overview of the process:', '1\\.  Homeowners use Emprove to create a home improvement project.', '2\\.  Emprove provides homeowners with a conceptual cost estimate of their project to help them conclude on a scale and quality of scope that they can generally afford. The conceptual cost estimate is not an offer to provide services, nor a guarantee of actual costs. The actual costs of the project will be as identified by the final cost proposal of the contractor who is selected by the homeowner at the conclusion of the bid process.', '3\\.  Emprove then provides homeowners with a detailed Request for Proposal (RFP) document that clearly conveys the scope of work the homeowner intends to undertake. When they are ready to go, homeowners submit their RFP to the contractor bid process.', '4\\.  The first step of the bid process is for Emprove to identify a set of contractors, who are uniquely qualified to performed the work identified in the RFP. These are the Matched Contractors for the project. Our objective is to provide at least 3 bids to the homeowner for review, but not more than 5.', '5\\.  Matched Contractors receive an email invitation from Emprove to submit a bid for the project. The email provides details of the project for the contractor’s consideration. A link is provided where contractors can “Accept to Bid” the project for free or they can “Pass” on it.', {

  }, '6\\.  In effort to convey the size of the project to each Matched Contractor, Emprove provides an Estimated Project Value Range. This range is Emprove’s estimate of project value yet contractors are not limited to providing a bid value within this range in any way.', '7\\.  Upon accepting to bid the project, and only if the contractor does not already have an activated profile with Emprove, the contractor will be asked to setup their profile. It is important new contractors complete the Expertise section of their profiles as this is the information Emprove uses to match contractors for future projects. Specifically, contractors should ensure they complete Trade Expertise, Project Specialty, and Contractor License information.', {

  }, '9\\.  Upon completing the initial bid process, the contractor will submit its preliminary bid to the homeowner, which is contingent upon a project site inspection and associated bid adjustment. There are no costs associated with the preliminary bid submission, it is completely free to submit.', '10\\.  Emprove provides each preliminary bid to the homeowner for their review. The homeowner shortlists 1 to 3 contractors to progress further in the bid process and conduct a project site inspection.', '11\\.  Shortlisted contractors review site conditions, present the homeowner with questions for clarification, and then are provided the opportunity to adjust their bid accordingly, if necessary. Finalized bids are submitted to the homeowner for final review', '12\\.  The homeowner selects their preferred contractor based on final bid submissions.', '13\\.  At time of selection, only the selected contractor will be charged a Success Fee. All unsuccessful contractors will conclude the bid process without having paid any fees.', '14\\.  The selected contractor and homeowner formally engage into an agreement directly with one another, not through Emprove. Emprove does not administer nor is party to the formal agreement.']
